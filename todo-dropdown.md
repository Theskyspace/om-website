## üöÄ NEW FEATURE: Equal AI Portrait Rectangle

### 13. Equal AI Portrait Rectangle Implementation
- [x] **Component Architecture:**
  - [x] Create new `EqualAIPortrait` component for the rounded portrait rectangle
  - [x] Install and integrate the `etheral-shadow` component for background effects
  - [x] Set up framer-motion dependencies if not already installed

- [x] **Visual Design & Layout:**
  - [x] Design portrait rectangle with rounded corners (aspect ratio: ~3:4 or 4:5)
  - [x] Implement gradient background using #00b140 and #baff29 colors
  - [x] Position Equal AI logo (@equal-ai.png) prominently in the container
  - [x] Add subtle shadow and glow effects matching the brand aesthetic

- [x] **Integration with Dropdown:**
  - [x] Position portrait rectangle beside the product dropdown main container
  - [x] Ensure proper spacing and alignment with existing dropdown layout
  - [x] Implement responsive behavior for different screen sizes
  - [x] Add smooth entrance animation synchronized with dropdown reveal

- [x] **Background Effects:**
  - [x] Integrate etheral-shadow component with custom gradient colors
  - [x] Configure animation settings: `scale: 100, speed: 90`
  - [x] Add noise overlay: `opacity: 0.8, scale: 1.2`
  - [x] Ensure background effects complement the Equal AI branding

- [x] **Responsive Adaptations:**
  - [x] Desktop (‚â•1024px): Full portrait rectangle beside dropdown
  - [x] Tablet (768px-1023px): Hidden on smaller screens (lg:block)
  - [x] Mobile (‚â§767px): Hidden to maintain clean mobile experience
  - [x] Ensure touch-friendly interactions on mobile devices

- [x] **Performance Considerations:**
  - [x] Optimize Equal AI logo image for different screen densities
  - [x] Use GPU acceleration for background animations
  - [x] Implement proper component loading with imports

  - [x] Smooth scale and position animations
  - [x] Smooth transitions between different responsive states

### 14. Implementation Efficiency Strategy
- [x] **Parallel Development:**
  - [x] Set up etheral-shadow component while designing portrait layout
  - [x] Create Equal AI logo optimizations alongside component development
  - [x] Test responsive behavior during development, not after completion

- [x] **Code Reuse:**
  - [x] Leverage existing animation utilities from dropdown component
  - [x] Reuse responsive breakpoint logic and CSS custom properties
  - [x] Utilize established color variables and design tokens

- [ ] **Testing Strategy:**
